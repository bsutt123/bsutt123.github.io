# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site created using React and Firebase for hosting. Its was meant to be a way for me to start learning more React and to have a more customizable application in the future for my portfolio

## Technology Overview

The site was built using React and was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you want to look at any specific functionality that create-react-app brings you should visit their page as they have provided exhaustive documentation on nearly every subject. Originally, the CSS for the site was precompiled with SASS, but I decided to start migrating to PostCSS after completion to take advantage of the amazing benefits that PostCSS has to offer. You will find `.scss` and `.module.css` files in the code as I move to a 100% PostCSS migration.

## Forking

While I do not recommend forking this repository to create your own website, as it is not intended to be a group collaboration or a template, you can fork the repository if you like. The project did eject from create-react-app to take advantage of custom configuration for PostCSS and some aliases, so you will need to be comfortable with webpack configurations.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to the React, Create React App and PostCSS teams for making _amazing_ tools that make developing for the modern web with responsive UI exciting, interesting, and overall just really fun.
