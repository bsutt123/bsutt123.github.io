            "Chat services are a great first application to build because they require a more dynamic control of the information that a static web page. The application needs to be able to read information from a database (in this case, firebase was used), let users log in, dynamically update rooms names, and overall track the state of the application.",
            "For this application, my real goal was to get first hand experience with how the largest frameworks are unique using an application that has similar end implementation. It was very helpful to get to see the strengths and weaknesses of each framework, and the chance to use each to build an application was exciting in itself. Using the three different frameworks as a learning experience was my main goal when implementing chatty."

The camp used an old carbon copy system for class management and trip requests that worked well, but required substantial labor hours to make sure that everything was in order and the trips were going to be successful",
            "I was hoping to make something that would let fewer people manage the camp more effectively by centralizing the information and analyzing the data on the fly to provide suggestions and to highlight possible issues that would arise from trip complications. There are hundreds of little details that go into planning a trip off campus, such as will there be enough counselors in the cabin, who is on their day off, is the camper allergic to anything, etc...",
            "This is my largest project, and in order to properly model the camps activities I had to make many intricately connected models to track and store information. The project also includes many complex forms to go with the nineteen different models, and the controllers for each model helps guide the form by eliminating results that do not fit the criteria for the form. There a lot of really cool interactions that you can explore on github."
